                <p>This is where and when I change my destiny. A long time ago, I chose to be a Musician, I had a purpose, logic, and everything seemed to help me through my path rationally, but due to life changes, I lost my way. This website is another step to be on my path to the Music. </p>

                     <p>Hello! My name is Mehdi Rahimi, but I go by Lucas M Freeman.</p>
                     <p>Welcome to my portfolio website for the courses I'm taking at Bellevue College. This website was my first attempt after 15 years hiatus from Computer World, so I can say that it is almost a new experience for me, and I have decided to transform this website into a professional official website for my Music career. You are welcome to explore and please let me know if you have any recommendations to improve it.</p>
