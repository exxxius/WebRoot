            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Well, I&rsquo;m really motivated &amp; passionate about music as much as you can&rsquo;t even imagine, I don&rsquo;t think any of you have got tortured by the government &amp; forced for leave your home country because of music, but I did &amp; it&rsquo;s a long story that I can tell you about it later... So you may get the point of how serious I am about music in my life. I&rsquo;m a 30 years old guy, apparently I don&rsquo;t have a Rock-star appearance. I&rsquo;ve been playing Guitar since 15 years ago. I studied World/Classical music at Tehran Conservatory and Jazz/Rock music at Vienna (Austria) Conservatory. I&rsquo;ve got some live experience with local bands in my country &amp; a few European tours as a guest performer for some Austrian Rock/Metal bands during 2007-2010. I don&rsquo;t do drugs/smoke. I was somehow away from music during 2011-2013 and I lost all my repertoire and compositions, recordings etc&hellip; I learn fast by Note, Tab or ear, so learning new songs is not a problem. I&rsquo;ve had my own home studio (who doesn&rsquo;t?!) for a few years and I&rsquo;ve got a little experience in recording stuff. This is the list of my current Guitars &amp; Amps/FX: </p>
            <p>Ibanez RG570EX (Custom wiring &amp; Seymour Duncan pickups) </p>
            <p>Ibanez Prestige RG3120 (Dimarzio pickups) </p>
            <p>Ibanez Prestige RG1527 7-Strings (Dimarzio pickups) </p>
            <p>Godin Multiac Jazz Semi-Hollow </p>
            <p>Greg Bennett Classical Cutaway </p>
            <p>ENGL SE E670 EL34 100W + ENGL XXL 4x12 Cab (No I don&rsquo;t have 2 cabs right now unfortunately) </p>
            <p>Marshall AVT-100 Combo</p>
            <p> Fractal Audio AxeFX-II XL+ </p>
            <p>Boss DS-1, MT-2, Crybaby Wah Pedal 535Q</p>
            <p> I&rsquo;m planning to get more FX &amp; Guitars a soon as I earn enough money! Well, I&rsquo;m currently living in Redmond, Washington, working 3 days of 18 hours rounds in a week, also study IS- Software Development at Bellevue College, Full-time. But I really can&rsquo;t take it anymore, I need to spend my time on things that I have love &amp; passion for which is Music&hellip; I have my driver&rsquo;s license and a truck, clean driving &amp; criminal record. I would love to hear your music and talk more about everything. If you have any questions or need more information, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask by email or simply call me. </p>
            <p>Thanks for reminding me that I&rsquo;m a Musician, not a Robot.</p>
